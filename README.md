# Event Sourcing Architectural Pattern
## Implementation for News/Post LIKE Count
An event-sourcing architecture to manage blog post or news like count.

## What is Event Sourcing?
Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern where the state of an application is determined by a sequence of events rather than the current state stored in a database. Instead of updating a database record directly, changes in the system are captured as a series of immutable events, which can be replayed to reconstruct the application's state at any point in time.
